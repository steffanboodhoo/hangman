# Hangman Game 

This was originally meant to be a problem I had to solve for an interview in 4 hours. I did not get the job =/, they did not tell me why but I think it was that I did all my frontend work in a single index.js and index.html. I did not think 4 hours is reasonable to use such tools, so I just decided I would rebuild it using React and such
